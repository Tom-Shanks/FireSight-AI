# FireSight AI - Wildfire Prediction and Prevention System

FireSight AI is a comprehensive platform for predicting, monitoring, and responding to wildfire threats using machine learning, satellite imagery, and environmental data analysis.

*Last updated: March 2025*

## Project Overview

FireSight AI combines advanced machine learning models with real-time environmental data to:

- Predict wildfire risk in specific geographic areas
- Monitor high-risk regions for early detection
- Simulate fire spread patterns based on terrain and weather conditions
- Assess potential damage to communities and ecosystems
- Provide actionable recommendations for prevention and response
