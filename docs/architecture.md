- **Features**:
  - Interactive 3D risk map
  - Real-time data visualization dashboards
  - Augmented reality visualization options
  - Alert management
  - User authentication with multi-factor support

### Backend API

- **Technology**: Express.js, Node.js (v20+), GraphQL
- **Purpose**: Serves as the middleware between the frontend and data services
- **Features**:
  - REST and GraphQL API endpoints
  - Authentication with OAuth 2.1 and FIDO2
  - Data validation with JSON Schema
  - API rate limiting and throttling
  - Comprehensive logging and monitoring
  - WebSocket connections for real-time updates

### Data Pipeline

- **Technology**: Python 3.11+, Pandas 2.x, PyTorch
- **Purpose**: Processes raw data and prepares it for model training
- **Features**:
  - Automated data collection from external sources
  - Advanced data cleaning and transformation
  - Real-time feature engineering
  - Distributed model training and evaluation
  - Automated hyperparameter optimization

### ML Models

## Data Flow

1. External data sources (satellite imagery, weather data) are ingested by the data pipeline
2. The data pipeline processes the data and stores it in the data storage
3. ML models are trained on the processed data
4. The backend API queries the ML models for predictions
5. The frontend dashboard displays the predictions to users
6. User interactions are processed by the backend and may trigger additional predictions

## Security Considerations

- All API endpoints are secured with authentication
- Sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit
- Rate limiting is implemented to prevent abuse
- Regular security audits are conducted

## Scalability

The system is designed to scale horizontally:

- Stateless API servers can be scaled with load balancers
- Database sharding for increased throughput
- Caching layer for improved performance
- Serverless functions for unpredictable workloads

## Deployment Strategy

- CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions
- Infrastructure as code using AWS CloudFormation
- Blue-green deployment for zero-downtime updates
- Automated testing before production deployment

## Monitoring and Logging

- Centralized logging with AWS CloudWatch
- Application performance monitoring
- Error tracking and alerting
- Usage analytics and dashboards
