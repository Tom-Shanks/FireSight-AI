## Option 2: Story-Driven

üî• **Colorado's 2020 fire season was devastating. I built something to help.**

After watching the Cameron Peak and East Troublesome fires threaten our communities, I knew there had to be a better way to monitor wildfires than expensive helicopter flights.

So I built FireSight AI Colorado - a drone-based monitoring system that just went live:
[tom-shanks.github.io/FireSight-AI](https://tom-shanks.github.io/FireSight-AI)

**The results?**
- 90% cheaper than helicopters
- 24/7 monitoring capability  
- Real-time updates every 5 minutes
- Currently tracking 8 active fires across Colorado

As a Part 107 pilot in Denver, I'm ready to help agencies save money while improving fire detection.

Check out the live demo and cost calculator. Your agency could save $125,000+ annually.
